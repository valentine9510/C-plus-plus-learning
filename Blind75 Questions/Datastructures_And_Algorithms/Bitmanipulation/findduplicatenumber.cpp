/**
 * 287. Find the Duplicate Number
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using only constant extra space.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 3

/**
 Use Floyds, cycle detection

 Code (Corrected with Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection):


 How This Works:
Cycle Detection (Phase 1):

Treat the array as a linked list where nums[i] points to the next node.
Use two pointers (slow and fast), moving slow by one step and fast by two steps to detect a cycle.
If there is a cycle, the two pointers will eventually meet.
Finding Duplicate (Phase 2):

After the cycle is detected, reset one pointer (slow) to the start of the array and move both pointers one step at a time.
The point where they meet again is the start of the cycle, which corresponds to the duplicate number.
