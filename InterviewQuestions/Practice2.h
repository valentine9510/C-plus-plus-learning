/**
 * Encrypted Words
You've devised a simple encryption method for alphabetic strings that shuffles the characters in such a way that the resulting string is hard to quickly read, but is easy to convert back into the original string.
When you encrypt a string S, you start with an initially-empty resulting string R and append characters to it as follows:
Append the middle character of S (if S has even length, then we define the middle character as the left-most of the two central characters)
Append the encrypted version of the substring of S that's to the left of the middle character (if non-empty)
Append the encrypted version of the substring of S that's to the right of the middle character (if non-empty)
For example, to encrypt the string "abc", we first take "b", and then append the encrypted version of "a" (which is just "a") and the encrypted version of "c" (which is just "c") to get "bac".
If we encrypt "abcxcba" we'll get "xbacbca". That is, we take "x" and then append the encrypted version "abc" and then append the encrypted version of "cba".

/**
 * @brief Minimizing Permutations
In this problem, you are given an integer N, and a permutation, P of the integers from 1 to N, denoted as (a_1, a_2, ..., a_N). You want to rearrange the elements of the permutation into increasing order, repeatedly making the following operation:
Select a sub-portion of the permutation, (a_i, ..., a_j), and reverse its order.
Your goal is to compute the minimum number of such operations required to return the permutation to increasing order.
Signature
int minOperations(int[] arr)
Input
Array arr is a permutation of all integers from 1 to N, N is between 1 and 8
Output
An integer denoting the minimum number of operations required to arrange the permutation in increasing order
Example
If N = 3, and P = (3, 1, 2), we can do the following operations:
Select (1, 2) and reverse it: P = (3, 2, 1).
Select (3, 2, 1) and reverse it: P = (1, 2, 3).
output = 2

/**
 * @brief Matching Pairs
Given two strings s and t of length N, find the maximum number of possible matching pairs in strings s and t after swapping exactly two characters within s.
A swap is switching s[i] and s[j], where s[i] and s[j] denotes the character that is present at the ith and jth index of s, respectively. The matching pairs of the two strings are defined as the number of indices for which s[i] and t[i] are equal.
Note: This means you must swap two characters at different indices.
Signature
int matchingPairs(String s, String t)
Input
s and t are strings of length N
N is between 2 and 1,000,000
Output
Return an integer denoting the maximum number of matching pairs
Example 1
s = "abcd"
t = "adcb"
output = 4
Explanation:
Using 0-based indexing, and with i = 1 and j = 3, s[1] and s[3] can be swapped, making it  "adcb".
Therefore, the number of matching pairs of s and t will be 4.
Example 2
s = "mno"
t = "mno"
output = 1
Explanation:
Two indices have to be swapped, regardless of which two it is, only one letter will remain the same. If i = 0 and j=1, s[0] and s[1] are swapped, making s = "nmo", which shares only "o" with t.

/**
 * @brief Seating Arrangements
There are n guests attending a dinner party, numbered from 1 to n. The ith guest has a height of arr[i-1] inches.
The guests will sit down at a circular table which has n seats, numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order around the table. As the host, you will choose how to arrange the guests, one per seat. Note that there are n! possible permutations of seat assignments.
Once the guests have sat down, the awkwardness between a pair of guests sitting in adjacent seats is defined as the absolute difference between their two heights. Note that, because the table is circular, seats 1 and n are considered to be adjacent to one another, and that there are therefore n pairs of adjacent guests.
The overall awkwardness of the seating arrangement is then defined as the maximum awkwardness of any pair of adjacent guests. Determine the minimum possible overall awkwardness of any seating arrangement.
Signature
int minOverallAwkwardness(int[] arr)
Input
n is in the range [3, 1000].
Each height arr[i] is in the range [1, 1000].
Output
Return the minimum achievable overall awkwardness of any seating arrangement.
Example
n = 4
arr = [5, 10, 6, 8]
output = 4
If the guests sit down in the permutation [3, 1, 4, 2] in clockwise order around the table (having heights [6, 5, 8, 10], in that order), then the four awkwardnesses between pairs of adjacent guests will be |6-5| = 1, |5-8| = 3, |8-10| = 2, and |10-6| = 4, yielding an overall awkwardness of 4. It's impossible to achieve a smaller overall awkwardness.

/**
 * @brief Queue Removals
You're given a list of n integers arr, which represent elements in a queue (in order from front to back). You're also given an integer x, and must perform x iterations of the following 3-step process:
Pop x elements from the front of queue (or, if it contains fewer than x elements, pop all of them)
Of the elements that were popped, find the one with the largest value (if there are multiple such elements, take the one which had been popped the earliest), and remove it
For each one of the remaining elements that were popped (in the order they had been popped), decrement its value by 1 if it's positive (otherwise, if its value is 0, then it's left unchanged), and then add it back to the queue
Compute a list of x integers output, the ith of which is the 1-based index in the original array of the element which had been removed in step 2 during the ith iteration.
Signature
int[] findPositions(int[] arr, int x)
Input
x is in the range [1, 316].
n is in the range [x, x*x].
Each value arr[i] is in the range [1, x].
Output
Return a list of x integers output, as described above.
Example
n = 6
arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]
x = 5
output = [5, 6, 4, 1, 2]
The initial queue is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5] (from front to back).
